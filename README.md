# [The Sleuth Kit with WFS0.4/5 support](http://www.sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit)

This is a fork to implement WFS0.4/5 support in The Sleuth Kit. WFS is a file system popular in chinese DVRs and we donÂ´t know any tool public available to extract videos from this file system.

This software should be used with care; I and a partner have decoded the filesystem from scratch and, of course, error are problable. In spite, we have succefully tested this implementation in a dozen of images acquired in several contexts. 

We have also implemented in Python a tool capable of extract videos. In some days, I will public that program. It is more convenient if you want just export videos using a GUI.

Galileu Batista
and Unaldo Brito (this guy have made a great work in decoding WFS).
